# Demonstration for Chrome Extension for Chatter

This is a demonstration of building a Chrome Extension for Salesforce.com Chatter. It was developed for my Dreamforce '12 presentation "Lessons Learned Building a Chatter Extension for Google Chrome"

It represents a simple Chatter News Feed, running as a Chrome Extension App.

## Installation

To install:
* Clone the repository to your local machine
* In the Chrome menu go to Tools -> Extensions
* Check "Developer Mode" if not already enabled
* Click "Load Unpacked Extension" and browse to the "src" folder in the repository.
* Chrome will install the extension. As this is a Chrome "App", you can easily launch it from the Apps panel of the Chrome "new tab" page.

## Notes

The source contains a Remote Access client ID specifically created for this Demo and for Dreamforce. If you intend to develop this further, then you should create your own Remote Access token in your Salesforce instance.
